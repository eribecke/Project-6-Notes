# Project-6-Notes

For this project I have created a notes app. The user can add new notes, modify old ones, and delete their notes.



## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User can add a new note by clicking the "Add Note" button.
* [ ] User can edit the title and description of their new note in the notes fragment that pops up.
* [ ] User can save the contents of their note by clicking the save button.
* [ ] User will be brought back to the home screen after hitting save or hitting the back button.
* [ ] User will see their saved notes on the home screen.
* [ ] User can click on their old notes to edit them.
* [ ] User can delete specific notes by hitting the red "X" next to the note's title.
* [ ] User will see a dialogue box after hitting the "X" where they can confirm the note's deletion by clicking "No" or "Yes".

## Notes

My biggest challenge was figuring out how to call view model methods from the layout files.
